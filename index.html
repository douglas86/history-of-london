            In the 19th century, a horse-bus or omnibus served as a significant
            means of passenger transportation in both the United States and
            Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
            These large horse-drawn carriages had an enclosed cabin for
            passengers, while the driver usually sat on a front-facing bench,
            positioned outside and at an elevated level.
          </p>
          <p>
            This setup allowed for efficient transport of people across various
            routes.

            1662—The Omnibus was first introduced in Paris, marking a
            significant milestone in public transportation.
          </p>
          <p>
            1677—After 15 years, the Omnibus service was discontinued due to
            increasing fare prices, and it became exclusive to high-society
            members.
          </p>
          <p>
            John Greenwood launched Manchester's first bus line, which didn't
            require any pre-bookings, making it more accessible to the public.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1827, Stanislas Baudry commissioned George Shillibeer, an English
            coach maker, to design a carriage capable of carrying a large number
            of customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 28th April 1828, George Shillibeer's successful design became the
            first omnibus in Paris, operating between La Madeleine and la
            Bastille at 15-minute intervals.
          </p>
          <p>
            London introduced its first omnibus in 1831, providing a new mode of
            public transportation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1833, legislation was passed in London, allowing these omnibuses
            to operate on the streets legally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thomas Tilling initiated horse bus services in 1850, but they faced
            challenges due to the limitations of horses, such as working hours,
            housing, grooming, feeding, and waste management.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1855, the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) was established
            to regulate horse-drawn omnibus services across the city. These
            systems required multiple horses per bus, leading to large stables
            for each bus system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around 1860, the advent of mass-produced steel facilitated the
            transition from horse-drawn to rail-based transportation, enabling a
            significant increase in passenger capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 1890, electric propulsion began to replace horse-drawn carts in
            major cities, further advancing public transportation.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 4th August 1914, the last horse-drawn cart service between
            Peckham and Honor Oak Tavern came to an end, marking the end of an
            era in urban transportation.

          <p>
            In 1830, the first proposal for an underground railway network in
            London emerged due to the city's significant growth and traffic
            congestion caused by the increasing commuting population.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 1850, several railway terminals were scattered around London's
            urban center.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1852, Charles Pearson, a Solicitor to the City of London,
            championed the idea of creating a railway from Farringdon to King's
            Cross through the City Terminus Company. Despite the city's support,
            the railway companies initially showed little interest, making
            progress challenging.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in 1854, the Metropolitan Railway (Met) was granted
            permission to build an underground line, becoming the world's first
            underground railway when it opened its doors in 1863.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, various extensions and expansions were made,
            including the Circle Line's completion in 1884, significantly
            expanding the railway service in and around London.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, in 1890, the city and South London Railway introduced
            electric trains, marking the beginning of the first deep-level tube
            line.
          </p>
          <p>
            The waterloo and city railway also commenced operations in 1898,
            while the District Railway expanded its services to Whitechapel.
          </p>
          <p>
            These developments laid the foundation for the extensive underground
            railway system that London relies on today.

              Fowler's Ghost, an experimental fireless steam locomotive designed
              by John Fowler, aimed to address the issues of smoke and steam in
              underground environments. Despite its innovative concept, the
              locomotive was not deemed successful, leading to the adoption of
              condensing steam locomotives instead.
