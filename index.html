            was a large horse-drawn carriage that was mainly used in the 19th
            century in both the United States and Europe. For the transportation
            of passengers. The driver would typically site on a front-facing
            bench normally on an elevated position outside from the passengers
            enclosed cabin.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was also a smaller version available, which was normally used
            at hotels and restaurants to conveyor servants and luggage to and
            from their destination.

          <p>
            1662—The Omnibus was first introduced in Paris, marking a
            significant milestone in public transportation.
          </p>
          <p>
            1677—After 15 years, the Omnibus service was discontinued due to
            increasing fare prices, and it became exclusive to high-society
            members.
          </p>
          <p>
            John Greenwood launched Manchester's first bus line, which didn't
            require any pre-bookings, making it more accessible to the public.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1827, Stanislas Baudry commissioned George Shillibeer, an English
            coach maker, to design a carriage capable of carrying a large number
            of customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 28th April 1828, George Shillibeer's successful design became the
            first omnibus in Paris, operating between La Madeleine and la
            Bastille at 15-minute intervals.
          </p>
          <p>
            London introduced its first omnibus in 1831, providing a new mode of
            public transportation.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1833, legislation was passed in London, allowing these omnibuses
            to operate on the streets legally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thomas Tilling initiated horse bus services in 1850, but they faced
            challenges due to the limitations of horses, such as working hours,
            housing, grooming, feeding, and waste management.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1855, the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) was established
            to regulate horse-drawn omnibus services across the city. These
            systems required multiple horses per bus, leading to large stables
            for each bus system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around 1860, the advent of mass-produced steel facilitated the
            transition from horse-drawn to rail-based transportation, enabling a
            significant increase in passenger capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 1890, electric propulsion began to replace horse-drawn carts in
            major cities, further advancing public transportation.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 4th August 1914, the last horse-drawn cart service between
            Peckham and Honor Oak Tavern came to an end, marking the end of an
            era in urban transportation.

            was an experimental fireless steam locomotive designed by John
            Fowler to prevent smoke and steam underground. It was not considered
            a success, and condensing steam locomotives were used.

            1830 – The first proposal of an underground railway networking
            linking the city of London
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: In the first half of the 19th century, London had grown
            greatly and the development of a commuting population arriving by
            train each day led to traffic congestion with carts, cabs and
            omnibuses filling the roads.
          </p>
          <p>
            1850 – there were several railway terminals located around the urban
            center of London
          </p>
          <p>
            1852 – Charles Pearson, a Solicitor to the City of London, was a
            leading promoter of several schemes and the creation of the City
            Terminus Company to build such a railway from Farringdon to King’s
            Cross.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: with the City of London supporting the idea, the railway
            companies were not interested, and the company struggled to proceed.
          </p>
          <p>
            1854 – The Metropolitan Railway (known as the Met) was granted
            permission to build an underground line at an estimated cost of £1
            million.
          </p>
          <p>
            1860 – Construction only started until March, as the met found it
            hard to raise the capital with the Crimean War under way.
          </p>
          <p>
            1863 – the world’s first underground railway opened its doors. The
            Metropolitan Railway, using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam
            locomotives working with the district Railway.
          </p>
          <p>
            1863 – 10 January, a 6 km railway was opened to the public. Mostly
            built using the “cut-and-cover” method from Paddington to King’s
            Cross, east of King’s Cross was built by tunneling and then followed
            the culverted River Fleet in an open cutting to the new meat market
            at Smithfield. Carrying in at about 38000 passengers on the opening
            day, within the first 12 months, it had carried 9.5 million
            passengers. Within the 2nd twelve months, this increased to 12
            million.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: With the Met’s early success, it prompted a group of
            applications to parliament the new railways in London, many
            competing for similar routes. The House of Lords established a
            select committee that recommended an “inner circuit of railway that
            should join nearly all the principal railway terminals in the
            Metropolis.”
          </p>
          <p>
            1864 – The Metropolitan Railway had been extended soon after
            opening, reaching Hammersmith with the Great Western Railway.
          </p>
          <p>
            1869 – passage was dug through the London Clay under the Thames from
            Great Tower Hill to Pickle Herring Stairs near Vine Street (now Vine
            Lane)
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: A circular 2.1m tunnel was dug 410m using a wrought iron
            shield. A method that had been patented in 1864 by Peter William
            Barlow. A railway was laid in that tunnel
          </p>
          <p>
            1870 – August, a wooden carriage conveyed passengers from one side
            to the other. Later that year the company went bankrupt as the
            tunnel was considered to be uneconomical, they then converted it to
            pedestrian use, known today as the Tower Subway.
          </p>
          <p>
            1871 – the District began operating its own trains, the railway had
            extended to West Brompton and a terminus at Mansion House.
            Hammersmith was reached from Earl’s Court, and serves reached
            Richmond, Ealing, Hounslow and Wimbledon.
          </p>
          <p>
            1877 – The Met & St John’s Wood Railway opened as a single track
            branch from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage. This was to be the Met’s
            the most important route as it expanded north into the Middlesex
            countryside, were it stimulated the development of new suburbs.
          </p>
          <p>
            1879 – with the Met now wishing to access the South Eastern Railway
            via the East London Railway (ELR), Act of Parliament was obtained to
            complete the circle and link to the ELR.
          </p>
          <p>
            1880 – Harrow was reached and the line was extended to Verney
            Junction in Buckinghamshire more than 80 km from Baker Street and
            the center of London.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: towards the end of the 19th century, the railway shared tracks
            with the Great Central Railway route out of Marylebone.
          </p>
          <p>
            1884 – 17 September, an official opening ceremony was conducted for
            the completing and train run of the Circle Line
          </p>
          <p>1884 – 6 October, starting of the circle line</p>
          <p>
            1884 – The completion of the Circle line, which expanded the railway
            service by more than 50km from Baker Street and the center of
            London.
          </p>
          <p>1884 – October that year the Circle line was completed.</p>
          <p>
            1886 – Construction of the city and south London Railway (C&SLR) was
            started by James Henry Greathead.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: 3.1m circular tunnels were dug between King William Street
            (close to today’s Monument station) and Elephant and Castle. From
            Elephant and Castle, the tunnels were a slightly larger 3.2m to
            Stockwell. These series of tunnels were bored under the surface so
            that they didn’t need any agreements from property owners.
          </p>
          <p>
            1890 – The first deep-level tube line, the city and South London
            Railway with electric trains.
          </p>
          <p>1898 – The waterloo and city railway opened its doors</p>
          <p>
            1898 – the District began to serve Whitechapel as a result of the
            expansion.
