        <div class="dates">
          <p>
            1900 – the opening of a 3.562m diameter tunnel was dug beneath the
            roads between Shepherd’s Bush and Bank for the Central London
            Railway. Charging a flat fare of 2d (approximately 96p today) known
            as the “2-penny tube.” By the end of that year, it had carried
            nearly 15 million passengers.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: Initially electric locomotives hauled carriages, but the heavy
            locomotives caused vibrations that could be felt on the surface.
          </p>
          <p>1900 – Central London Railway opened</p>
          <p>
            1901 – a metropolitan and district joint committee recommended the
            Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. This was accepted by
            both parties until the District found an investor, the American
            Charles Yerkes, to finance the upgrade. Yerkes raised £1 million
            (adjusted for inflation, £115 million) and soon had control of the
            District Railway.
          </p>
          <p>
            1902 – an Underground electric railway company of London (UERL) was
            established to fund the district lines and complete operations of 3
            tube lines.
          </p>
          <p>
            1902 – 550 trains operated daily. Services began running to
            Upminster
          </p>
          <p>
            1903 – the carriages were reformed into multiple units using a
            control system developed by Frank Sprague in Chicago.
          </p>
          <p>1904 – Great Northern and city railway opened up</p>
          <p>
            1904 – The great northern & city railway was built to take main line
            trains from the Great Northern Railway at Finsbury Park to the city
            at a terminus at Moorgate; however, the GNR refused permission for
            trains to use its Finsbury Park Station. So platforms were built
            beneath the station and public service on the line, using electric
            multiple units.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: With most of the District and metropolitan Railways using
            steam locomotives led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that
            were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the
            way forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            1905 – Metropolitan electricifed the new line from Harrow to
            Uxbridge and the route to the inner circle at Baker Street, the
            distict line electrified its unopened line from Mill Hill Park (now
            Action Town) to South Harrow and used these new lines to test its
            new trains and drivers.
          </p>
          <p>
            1906 – Baker Street, Waterloo, Charing Cross, Euston, Hampstead,
            Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway opened up and
            started its operations
          </p>
          <p>
            1907 – District and Metropolitan Railway had electrified the
            underground sections of their lines.
          </p>
          <p>
            1907 – The carriages were fitted with small windows and consequently
            were nicknamed padded cells. The C&CLR had extended from both ends,
            south to Clapham common and north to Euston.
          </p>
          <p>
            1908 – Center London Railway (CLR) was extended to Wood Lane (near
            White city)
          </p>
          <p>1912 – which was then extended to Liverpool Street</p>
          <p>
            1915 – The underground was used as shelter during the Great War
            (also known World War 1) during Zeppelin air raids in June of that
            year.
          </p>
          <p>
            1930 – Central and Northern lines formed part of the New Works
            Program.
          </p>
          <p>
            1933 – London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) was established.
            Which was there to oversee all the underground railways and all
            London area tram and bus operators.
          </p>
          <p>
            1939 – During World War 2 all operations either halted or
            interrupted some work, and many tube stations were used as air-raid
            shelter.
          </p>
          <p>
            1948 – London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) was nationalized.
            With the mainline railways given priority over the maintenance of
            the Underground.
          </p>
          <p>
            1953 – unpainted aluminum train entered service on the District
            line, which became the standard for all new trains.
          </p>
          <p>
            1960 – the Metropolitan line was electrified as far as Amersham,
            with steam powered locomotives no longer hauled passenger trains.
          </p>
          <p>
            1968 – the Victorian line opened in central London. With trains
            driven automatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            1976 – Northern city line was overtaken by British Rail, and they
            linked it up with the mainline railway at Finsbury Park.
          </p>
          <p>
            1979 – a new route, the Jubilee line, took over parts of the
            Bakerloo line, extending as far as Docklands. 1980 – the Travelcard
            and Capitalcard was introduced
          </p>
          <p>
            1981 – Under the Greater London council, London Transport introduced
            a fare zone for buses and underground trains, cutting the average
            fare price.
          </p>
          <p>
            1999 – before control was passed onto Transport For London (TFL),
            the London Underground was split up so that a public-private
            partnership (PPP) arrangement could be put in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            1999 – extension of the rail from Docklands to as far as Stratford.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: In the early years of the 21st century, London underground was
            reorganized in a public-private partnership where private companies
            upgraded and maintained the infrastructure.

          <p>
            1909 – Thomas Tilling and the LGOC entered into an agreement to pool
            all their resources. This agreement had restricted Thomas Tilling
            from expanding in London. Allowing LGOC to amalgamate most of
            London’s bus services. Thomas Clarkson had started a National Steam
            Car Company to run steam buses in London to be in competition with
            the LGOC.
          </p>

            1924 – under the London Traffic Act, the Metropolitan Police was
            authorized to allocate route numbers, which all buses had to carry.
            Which led to chaos taken away from the police and handed once again
            to professional busmen.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: Decades later the suffixes were gradually abolished. The last
            such route in London was the 77A, which became the 87 in June 2006.

            Transport name.

          <p class="subtext">
            Note: LPTB, under Lord Ashfield assumed responsibility for all bus
            services in the London Passenger Transport Area. The area had a

          </p>
