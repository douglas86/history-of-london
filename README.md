# History of London Transportation System

---

## [Introduction](#table-of-content)

This is my First Milestone Project with Code Insitute.

I thought of building a website on the history of Transportation in London from the 1800s.
As my country of origin doesn't have the same transportation network that the UK has to offer.

This site is deployed live on GitHub Pages

## [User Experience (UX)](#table-of-content)

### Motivation for this project

- History was always an interest for me
- I was amazed at the sure size of the London Transportation System
- Being the fact that I have two checkboxes ticked, the history of the transport system would've been the best
  choice to bring my idea to life
- This would also be a way of showing off my skills to potential employers

### The aim and goal for a first time user

- Build an attractive site for the history of London Transportation System
- To show a brief history taken from the Omnibus in the 19th Century to the Bus and London Underground in the 21st
  Century
- To show off one of the oldest transportation systems in the World

### The aim of any returning visitors

- Nice display that is nicely formatted and easy to read
- Links on the Footer to show were the resources were gathered from

## [Website Design](#table-of-content)

### Color Palete

![colour-palete.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fcolour-palete.png)

[Website of Color Palete](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23D6B65E&sub=1)

### Typograpy

- Google fonts were used to display my text using a link tag in each html document
- Once the Link was there, I used font-family with three fonts to fall back if needed
- Lumanosimo as the Primary font
- cursive as the Secondry font
- Delicious Handrawn as the third font

### Images

- Each page has a main heading depicting the transportation at the time
- The landing page has four images including the main image at the top
- There is a total of seven images on the 20th century page
- One of the images is hidden on certain screen sizes
- There are five images on the 21st century page
- There are four images next to the links on the footer

### Videos

- I am using an embedded YouTube video link to display the video on Landing Page
- This video takes you through a bit of the history of the omnibus to the electric bus
- I left it completely up to the user to play the video of not.

## [Wireframe Diagram](#table-of-content)

### Website Design Idea

- Although this is the wireframe of my design
- My design has changed slightly since then

Bottom of design

![wireframe-2.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fwireframe-2.png)

### Old idea that I had and never used

This was an Idea that I had, I was planning to do a history on the different types of lines in the Underground.
But it became complicated as there was not enough information to go on and all the info was scattered. Between to
many documents.

Bottom of design

This was a second idea that I had, I was going to do a website on the different companies on the London Underground.
One of the Main reasons for not doing it was that there were too many to choose from.

## Installing locally and how it was deployed live

### Installing locally

git clone if using ssh or http

- git clone git@github.com:douglas86/history-of-london.git
- git clone https://github.com/douglas86/history-of-london.git

And then use either live server on VS code or icons in the top right in intellij

![icons-intellij.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Ficons-intellij.png)

### How I got it to go live

Making live on GitHub pages

- Go to your GitHub repo
- Under the settings tab

![settings-tab.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fsettings-tab.png)

- On the side panel on the Left
- There will be a section called Code and Automation
- Click on the one that says pages

![pages-tab.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fpages-tab.png)

- On the right side, there is a section called Build and Deployment
- Under the branch section make sure that the branch says main
- Then save

![branches.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fbranches.png)

- Then go to the action tab, it should be built there
- Give it a few minutes to finish

![action-tab.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Faction-tab.png)

- When finished, click on the link, using ctrl + click
- this will open in a new tab

![deployed-site.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fdeployed-site.png)

- Whenever you want to visit your live site
- You can go back to the pages section under the settings tab

## Technology Used

### Languages Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

### Frameworks - Libraries - Programs Used

- Google fonts—for the use of fonts in site
- GitHub—version control system
- IntelliJ IDEA—IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for coding out the website
- Google Chrome—for research and developer tools

Making full use of branching methodology when using GitHub

![Graph of git branching.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2FGraph%20of%20git%20branching.png)

- When I started this project, I used a Branching methodology of working in and out of a develop branch like they
  would in industry
- Initially, I wasn't commiting enough
- When I did the Love Running Project, it showed the correct method to be used
- I had only done that project towards the finish of this Project
- This project was a great learning curve on what I need to improve on for the next project

## Problems And Bugs

### Problem 1: _Navbar_

- Problem: The navbar on the 1900s and 2000s page doesn't change on a smaller device,
  but it is correct on the Landing page.

This is how it looks

![navbar-desktop.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fnavbar-desktop.png)

This is how it is supposed to look

![navbar-mobile.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fnavbar-mobile.png)

- Problem Solved: It turns out that it was a meta tag issue, I had only one meta tag in the 1900s and 2000s page, when
  it should have been 3.

Before

![meta-tags-1.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fmeta-tags-1.png)

After

![meta-tags-2.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fmeta-tags-2.png)

### Problem 2: Timeline and image in the same line

- Problem: The image is not supposed to be in the same line as the Timeline heading, it was only like that on laptop
  screen sizes
- Problem Solved: The margin was adjusted at breakpoint 1200px for those images

Before

![Problem-2-Before.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2FProblem-2-Before.png)

After
