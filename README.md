## [Introduction](#table-of-content)

This is my First Milestone Project with Code Insitute.

I thought of building a website on the history of Transportation in London from the 1800s.
As my country of origin doesn't have the same transportation network that the UK has to offer.

## [Wireframe Diagram](#table-of-content)

### <span style="color:#996515">Website Design Idea</span>

### <span style="color:#996515">Old idea that I had and never used</span>

This was an Idea that I had, I was planning to do a history on the different types of lines in the Underground.
But it became complicated as there was not enough information to go on and all the info was scattered. Between to
many documents.

Bottom of design

This was a second idea that I had, I was going to do a website on the different companies on the London Underground.
One of the Main reasons for not doing it was that there were too many to choose from.

## [Website Design](#table-of-content)

![colour-palete.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fcolour-palete.png)<br>

[Website of Color Palete](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23D6B65E&sub=1)

### <span style="color:#996515">Typograpy</span>

- Google fonts were used to display my text using a link tag in each html document
- Once the Link was there, I used font-family with 3 fonts to fall back if needed
- Lumanosimo as the Primary font
- cursive as the Secondry font
- Delicious Handrawn as the third font

### <span style="color:#996515">Images</span>

- Each page has a main heading depicting the transportation at the time
- The Omnibus section of the Landing page has 2 images
- The one image describes what an Omnibus is the other is just a short display
- There are 5 images for the London Underground split between 3 pages
- There are 3 images for the Bus section on 2 of the pages
- There are 4 images on the footer with links to take you to the source of were I got the information from

### <span style="color:#996515">Videos</span>

- There is one YouTube video that was downloaded from the internet
- This video takes you through a bit of the history of the omnibus to the electric bus
- Attributes on the video element: autoplay, muted, controls, loop
