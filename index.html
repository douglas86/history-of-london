            was a large horse-drawn carriage that was mainly used in the 19th
            century in both the United States and Europe. For the transportation
            of passengers. The driver would typically site on a front-facing
            bench normally on an elevated position outside from the passengers
            enclosed cabin.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was also a smaller version available, which was normally used
            at hotels and restaurants to conveyor servants and luggage to and
            from there destination.

            design worked and was implemented as the first omnibus in Paris and
            began its journey between La Madeleine and la Bastille running every
            15 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>1831 – The first omnibus was introduced in London.</p>
          <p>
            1833 – legislation was passed to allow these vehicles to plow the

          <p>1850 – Thomas Tilling started horse bus services</p>
          <p>
            1855 – London General Omnibus Company or LGOC was funded to regulate
            the horse-drawn omnibus services operating in London
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: as horses could only work for a limited number of hours in a
            day, as they had to be housed, groomed, fed, and they produced large
            amounts of manure which omnibus companies had to store and dispose
            of. Many systems needed to have 10 or more horses at a stable for
            each bus system.

            was an experimental fireless steam locomotive designed by John

            1830 – The first proposal of an underground railway networking
            linking the city of London
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: In the first half of the 19th century, London had grown
            greatly and the development of a commuting population arriving by
            train each day led to traffic congestion with carts, cabs and
            omnibuses filling the roads.
          </p>
          <p>
            1850 – there were several railway terminals located around the urban
            center of London
          </p>
          <p>
            1852 – Charles Pearson a Solicitor to the City of London was a
            leading promoter of several schemes and the creation of the City
            Terminus Company to build such a railway from Farringdon to King’s
            Cross.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: with the City of London supporting the idea, the railway
            companies were not interested and the company struggled to proceed.
          </p>
          <p>
            1854 – The Metropolitan Railway (known as the Met) was granted
            permission to build an underground line at an estimated cost of £1
            million.
          </p>
          <p>
            1860 – Construction only started until March, as the met found it
            hard to raise the capital with the Crimean War under way.
          </p>
          <p>
            1863 – the world’s first underground railway opened its doors. The
            Metropolitan Railway, using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam
            locomotives working with the district Railway.
          </p>
          <p>
            1863 – 10 January, a 6 km railway was opened to the public. Mostly
            built using the “cut-and-cover” method from Paddington to King’s
            Cross, east of King’s Cross was built by tunneling and then followed
            the culverted River Fleet in an open cutting to the new meat market
            at Smithfield. Carrying in at about 38000 passengers on the opening
            day, within the first 12 months it had carried 9.5 million
            passengers. Within the 2nd twelve months this increased to 12
            million.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: With the Met’s early success it prompted a group of
            application to parliament the new railways in London, many competing
            for similar routes. The House of Lords established a select
            committee that recommended an “inner circuit of railway that should
            join nearly all the principal railway terminals to the Metropolis”.
          </p>
          <p>
            1864 – The Metropolitan Railway had been extended soon after
            opening, reaching Hammersmith with the Great Western Railway.
          </p>
          <p>
            1869 – passage was dug through the London Clay under the Thames from
            Great Tower Hill to Pickle Herring Stairs near Vine Street (now Vine
            Lane)
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: A circular 2.1m tunnel was dug 410m using a wrought iron
            shield. A method that had been patented in 1864 by Peter William
            Barlow. A railway was laid in that tunnel
          </p>
          <p>
            1870 – August, a wooden carriage conveyed passengers from one side
            to the other. Later that year the company went bankrupt as the
            tunnel was considered to be uneconomical, they then converted it to
            pedestrian use, known today as the Tower Subway.
          </p>
          <p>
            1871 – the District began operating its own trains, the railway had
            extended to West Brompton and a terminus at Mansion House.
            Hammersmith was reached from Earl’s Court and serves reached
            Richmond, Ealing, Hounslow and Wimbledon.
          </p>
          <p>
            1877 – The Met & St John’s Wood Railway opened as a single track
            branch from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage. This was to be the Met’s
            most important route as it expanded north into the Middlesex
            countryside, were it stimulated the development of new suburbs.
          </p>
          <p>
            1879 – with the Met now wishing to access the South Eastern Railway
            via the East London Railway (ELR), Act of Parliament was obtained to
            complete the circle and link to the ELR.
          </p>
          <p>
            1880 – Harrow was reached and the line was extended to Verney
            Junction in Buckinghamshire more than 80 km from Baker Street and
            the center of London.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: towards the end of the 19th century, the railway shared tracks
            with the Great Central Railway route out of Marylebone.
          </p>
          <p>
            1884 – 17 September, an official opening ceremony of the completing

            service by more than 50km from Baker Street and the center of
            London.
          </p>
          <p>1884 – October that year the Circle line was completed.</p>
          <p>
            1886 – Construction of the city and south London Railway (C&SLR) was
            started by James Henry Greathead.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: 3.1m circular tunnels were dug between King William Street
            (close to today’s Monument station) and Elephant and Castle. From
            Elephant and Castle, the tunnels were a slightly larger 3.2m to
            Stockwell. These series of tunnels were bored under the surface so
            that they didn’t need any agreements from property owners.
          </p>
          <p>
            1890 – The first deep-level tube line, the city and South London
