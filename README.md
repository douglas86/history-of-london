## [Introduction](#table-of-content)

This is my First Milestone Project with Code Insitute.

I thought of building a website on the history of Transportation in London from the 1800s.
As my country of origin doesn't have the same transportation network that the UK has to offer.

## [Website Design](#table-of-content)

### Color Palete

![colour-palete.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fcolour-palete.png)

[Website of Color Palete](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23D6B65E&sub=1)

### Typograpy

- Google fonts were used to display my text using a link tag in each html document
- Once the Link was there, I used font-family with three fonts to fall back if needed
- Lumanosimo as the Primary font
- cursive as the Secondry font
- Delicious Handrawn as the third font

### Images

- Each page has a main heading depicting the transportation at the time
- The Omnibus section of the Landing page has two images
- The one image describes what an Omnibus is the other is just a short display
- There are five images for the London Underground split between three pages
- There are three images for the Bus section on 2 of the pages
- There are four images on the footer with links to take you to the source of were I got the information from

### Videos

- There is one YouTube video that was downloaded from the internet
- This video takes you through a bit of the history of the omnibus to the electric bus
- Attributes on the video element: autoplay, muted, controls, loop

### Old idea that I had and never used

This was an Idea that I had, I was planning to do a history on the different types of lines in the Underground.
But it became complicated as there was not enough information to go on and all the info was scattered. Between to
many documents.

- Bottom of design

This was a second idea that I had, I was going to do a website on the different companies on the London Underground.
One of the Main reasons for not doing it was that there were too many to choose from.

## Problems And Bugs

### _Navbar_

### Problem 1

- Problem: The navbar on the 1900s and 2000s page doesn't change on a smaller device,
  but it is correct on the Landing page.

![navbar-desktop.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fnavbar-desktop.png)

- This is how it looks

![navbar-mobile.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fnavbar-mobile.png)

- This is how it is supposed to look

- Problem Solved: It turns out that it was a meta tag issue, I had only one meta tag in the 1900s and 2000s page, when
  it should have been 3.

![meta-tags-1.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fmeta-tags-1.png)

- Before

![meta-tags-2.png](assets%2Fimages%2Freadme%2Fmeta-tags-2.png)

- After

### Problem 2

- Problem: The bootstrap styling that has been applied to this branch is messing up my original styling
