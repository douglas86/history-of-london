            The Central line opened as the "Twopenny tube" in 1900. A Northern
            line train leaves a tunnel mouth just north of Hendon Central
            station.

            roads between Shepherd’s Bush and Bank for the Central London
            Railway. Charging a flat fare of 2d (approximately 96p today) known
            as the “2 penny tube”. By the end of that year it had carried nearly
            15 million passengers.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: Initially electric locomotives hauled carriages, but the heavy
            locomotives caused vibrations that could be felt on the surface.
          </p>
          <p>1900 – Central London Railway opened</p>
          <p>
            1901 – a metropolian and district joint committee recommended the
            Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. This was accepted by
            both parties until the District found an investor, the American
            Charles Yerkes to finance the upgrade. Yerkes raised £1 million
            (adjusted for inflation, £115 million) and soon had control of the
            District Railway.
          </p>
          <p>
            1902 – Underground electric railway company of London (UERL) was
            established to fund the district lines and complete operations of 3

            Upminster
          </p>
          <p>
            1903 – the carriages were reformed into multiple units using a
            control system developed by Frank Sprague in Chicago.
          </p>
          <p>1904 – Great Northern and city railway opened up</p>
          <p>
            1904 – The great northern & city railway was built to take main line
            trains from the Great Northern Railway at Finsbury Park to the city
            at a terminus at Moorgate, however the GNR refused permission for
            trains to use its Finsbury Park Station. So platforms were built
            beneath the station and public service on the line, using electric
            multiple units.
          </p>
          <p class="subtext">
            Note: With most of the District and metropolitan Railways using
            steam locomotives led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that
            were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the
            way forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            1905 – Metropolitan electricifed the new line from Harrow to

            1906 – Baker Street, Waterloo, Charing Cross, Euston, Hampstead,

          <p>
            1907 – The carriages were fitted with small windows and consequently
            were nicknamed padded cells. The C&CLR had extended from both ends,
            south to Clapham common and north to Euston.
          </p>
          <p>

            Which was there to oversee all the underground railways and all
            London area tram and bus operators.
          </p>
          <p>
            1939 – During World War 2 all operations either halted or
            interrupted some work, and many tube stations were used as air-raid
            shelter.
          </p>
          <p>
            1948 – London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) was nationalized.

            linked it up with the mainline railway at Finsbury Park.
          </p>
          <p>
            1979 – a new route the Jubilee line, took over parts of the Bakerloo
